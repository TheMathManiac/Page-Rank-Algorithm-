# Page-Rank-Algorithm-

## Goal Of The Page Rank Algorithm?

I wanted to sort through the teams of the premiere league and using game data from the past 10 seasons, implement a page rank algorithm that would help me
rank the best teams based on a range of factors (such as away wins, away losses, home wins, home losses, number of goals scored, games played etc)

## Technologies Utilised?

Python

## Underlying Theory Supporting Work?

Ergodic Markov chains
